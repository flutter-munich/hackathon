# Flutter Hackathon

### Register

Please fill out this form: [`forms.gle/G6EKjgQje7m9Prf88`](https://forms.gle/G6EKjgQje7m9Prf88). The submitted form will help us create the teams and will be used to pick winners for the giveaway items.

### Slack

Please join our Slack workspace: [`fluttermunich.slack.com`](https://fluttermunich.slack.com). Slack lets us share links, files and other material that would be inconvenient to share in real life.

### Intro slides

The slides are available on [Google Docs/Slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1A5AATckNQOrjMSqQFvnu0fXUllVV-YhJA_7MOcley5c/edit?usp=sharing), in case you want to look up something. You can always just ask me in person, too.

### GitHub

##### Register your team

One member of the team should [create a new "issue" here on GitHub](https://github.com/flutter-munich/hackathon/issues/new/choose). Use the "register team" issue template.

1. Pick a name for your team
2. List your team members' GitHub accounts
3. Leave a link to your repository

##### Create shared repository

Create a repository for your team where you can share your code with each other. Commit often so that your team members can check out the code and help you. Please do not skip this step or wait with creating the repository until the end of the event.

You can use any repository, or even set up a [free organization for your team](https://help.github.com/en/github/setting-up-and-managing-organizations-and-teams/creating-a-new-organization-from-scratch).

Use an open-source license. We recommend Apache 2.0.

We want that everybody who attends the event can later look up and learn from all the different solutions to the challenge.

# Aphasia App

### Motivation

> My mom had a stroke last year and since that she is suffering from Aphasia, an issue to recall and say words, numbers, dates, time, etc...
>
> Last week I was playing around with the calendar app on her iPhone and she started crying because she could not say when my birthday is.
>
> She can point to it in the calendar but just not say it.
>
> I would like to make an app for that is generating random numbers, dates, times, and saying it in German, English or Polish (since she is polish). This way, she could repeat after the app how to pronounce the numbers, dates, times, and practice on her own how to read and say numbers.
>
> There are some apps for kids that do that, but it is very frustrating for grown ups to use apps that are designed for children since they feel like an imbecile.

### Minimum requirements

* The app generate random numbers, dates, times
* The app reads the generated numbers, dates, times aloud to the user
* The app supports multiple languages, at least three
* The app is designed for adults with aphasia

You might add more features if you think it will result in a better application, user experience.
