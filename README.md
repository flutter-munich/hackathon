### Create shared repository

Create a repository for your team where you can share your code with each other. Commit often so that your team members can check out the code and help you.

Please do not skip this step or wait with creating the repository until the end of the event.

We want that everybody who attends the event can later look up all the different solutions to the challenge.

### Submit solution

TODO: create issue template with team member names, repository links, screenshots, and video recording.
