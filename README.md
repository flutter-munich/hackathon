# Flutter Hackathon

## Register

Please fill out this form: [`forms.gle/G6EKjgQje7m9Prf88`](https://forms.gle/G6EKjgQje7m9Prf88). The submitted form will help us create the teams and will be used to pick winners for the giveaway items.

## Slack

Please join our Slack workspace: [`fluttermunich.slack.com`](https://fluttermunich.slack.com). Slack lets us share links, files and other material that would be inconvenient to share in real life.

## GitHub

### Register your team

One member of the team should [create a new "issue" here on GitHub](https://github.com/flutter-munich/hackathon/issues/new/choose). Use the "register team" issue template.

1. Pick a name for your team
2. List your team members' GitHub accounts
3. Leave a link to your repository

### Create shared repository

Create a repository for your team where you can share your code with each other. Commit often so that your team members can check out the code and help you. Please do not skip this step or wait with creating the repository until the end of the event.

You can use any repository, or even set up a [free organization for your team](https://help.github.com/en/github/setting-up-and-managing-organizations-and-teams/creating-a-new-organization-from-scratch).

Use an open-source license. We recommend Apache 2.0.

We want that everybody who attends the event can later look up and learn from all the different solutions to the challenge.
